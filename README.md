### A bit about me
I originally studied **graphic design**, which gave me a strong foundation in visual thinking, creativity and attention to detail.

For the past 9 years I worked in credit management, focusing on data analysis, process optimization, statisticsadn project management – skills I now see as highly transferable to development (problem-solving, logical thinking, precision).

Web development has always pulled me in – I love the idea of building interactive things people can actually use.  
That's why I'm now fully committed to this career change and actively teaching myself modern frontend technologies.

Open to junior frontend opportunities!
